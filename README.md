# Homegrown Brain

Welcome to the Homegrown Brain project! This application is designed to process and ingest data from a spreadsheet into a MongoDB database. The data represents a series of comments and responses from a TikTok post, and the goal of this project is to structure and store this data in a way that's easy to access and analyze.

## Functionality

The application works in several steps:

1. **Reading the Spreadsheet:** The application begins by reading an Excel spreadsheet using the `readSpreadsheet.js` utility. This utility uses the `xlsx` library to read the spreadsheet and convert the first sheet into a JSON object.

2. **Processing the Data:** The `processData.js` utility then takes this JSON object and processes it. It filters out any rows that don't have a value for the 'Comment' or 'Reply3' fields, and then maps the data to a new format that's suitable for our MongoDB database.

3. **Connecting to MongoDB:** Using the MongoDB Node.js driver, the application connects to a MongoDB server. The connection string and server API version are specified in the `test.js` file.

4. **Ingesting the Data:** The application then ingests the processed data into the MongoDB database. It does this by creating a new `LLMChain` for each comment-response pair, calling the `LLMChain`, and then inserting the result into the database.

## Intended Use

This application is intended to be a robust and efficient solution for processing and storing TikTok comment data. By storing this data in a MongoDB database, we can easily perform complex queries and analyses on the data. This could be useful for a variety of purposes, such as sentiment analysis, trend identification, or social media monitoring.

The application is designed to be flexible and adaptable. The `readSpreadsheet.js` and `processData.js` utilities can be modified to handle different spreadsheet formats or data processing requirements. Similarly, the MongoDB connection settings and `LLMChain` configuration can be adjusted to suit different databases or data structures.

## Future Work

While the application is currently functional, there are several areas where it could be improved:

- **Error Handling:** More comprehensive error handling could be added to catch and handle any errors that might occur during the reading, processing, and inserting of data.

- **Code Review:** The code could benefit from a review by another developer. They might be able to spot any issues or areas for improvement that have been missed.

- **Documentation:** More detailed documentation could be added to explain how each part of the application works and how to use it.

- **Unit Testing:** Unit tests could be added to ensure that each part of the application is working correctly.

- **Security:** The security of the MongoDB connection could be improved by storing the connection string in an environment variable instead of in the code.

I hope you find this application useful, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves in the future!
