            "Soap does not kill bacteria per se. Soap removes bacteria by suspending it so that it can be washed away when you rinse with water. The problem that a loofah poses is that due to the interweaving fibers, it traps the bacteria and organic material in there. Soap alone doesn't kill the bacteria. There's actually a published medical case study where a man spread a bacterial infection all over his body from using a loofah. He used soap with it, but still got the infection because the bacteria was still able to grow and spread: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8760476/",

            "That's correct and that's by design. If you're coming from using a loofah, Sud Scrub will not lather as much as a loofah does. The reason why loofahs lather soap so well is due to the interweaving fibers, which can cause you to use too little soap (producing so many bubbles that you end up using less soap than you actually should) and also makes it a reservoir for bacteria and mold. There isn't a way for us to make Sud Scrub lather like that without adopting the same design which would defeat the purpose of the product - which is to stay clean and reduce bacterial growth. I hear you though, and we'll continue to explore ways we can improve on this. Thank you for your feedback :)",

        "replies": [
            "1) Are you using your Sud Scrub away from running water? Although the design of the scrubber is meant to trap as much soap as possible, silicone, at the end of the day, is a non-porous material, which means soap will wash away quite easily when running water hits it. This same property also helps the scrubber dry very quickly and not hold any moisture that allows mold and germs to grow.\n\n2) Are you placing your soap directly onto the fins in a complete circle, avoiding the center? A common misconception is that the hole in the center is where you‚Äôre supposed to put your soap. The product spreads soap much more effectively when the soap is placed onto the fins and not the center.\n\n3) When it feels like you‚Äôre running out of suds, you can wet your scrubber and start scrubbing again. This will help extend the life of your soap/suds, as there is usually more soap remaining on the fins.\n\n4) If all fails, it might mean that your soap doesn‚Äôt have a very high lather to being with. Low-lather soaps such as cream-based ones won‚Äôt lather very well with Sud Scrub as the product is designed to work with the natural lather of your soap and will not make your soap lather any more than it naturally does. Loofahs work a bit differently as they trap water very well (like a sponge), which allows for high lather no matter what kind of soap you use. Unfortunately, this is the same reason why loofahs breed bacteria and mold so easily."
